> Compiled code to run our analyses can be found under the **code** subdirectory in the shell script *Code_Supplemental.sh*
>> its probably best to run the annotated code chunks seperatly instead of just executing the whole script


> The simulated data that serves as a basis for our filtering comparisons can be found in the **data** subdirectory
>> We provide the simulated data for all the iterations at different depth thresholds and filtering parameters as well as the corresponding true genotypes.
